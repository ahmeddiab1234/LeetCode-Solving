    "## Explanation of the Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Filter Odd-Numbered IDs**:  \n",
    "   - The condition `id % 2 != 0` selects only rows where the `id` is an odd number.  \n",
    "   - For example, in the input table:  \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     id: 1, 3, 5 are odd-numbered.\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exclude \"Boring\" Descriptions**:  \n",
    "   - The condition `description != 'boring'` excludes any rows where the `description` column contains the value \"boring\".  \n",
    "   - In the input table:  \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     id: 3 is excluded because its description is \"boring\".\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sort by Rating in Descending Order**:  \n",
    "   - The `ORDER BY rating DESC` clause sorts the results in descending order based on the `rating` column.  \n",
    "   - After filtering, the remaining rows are sorted so that higher-rated movies appear at the top.  \n",
