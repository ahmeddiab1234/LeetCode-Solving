    "  - Bought product `5` and product `6`, so they bought all products and are included in the result.  \n",

    "To solve this problem:  \n",
    "1. Join the `Customer` table with the `Product` table on `product_key`.  \n",
    "2. Group by `customer_id` to count how many distinct products each customer bought.  \n",
    "3. Compare this count with the total number of products in the `Product` table.  \n",
    "4. Use `HAVING` to filter customers who bought all products.  \n",
